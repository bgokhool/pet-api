# Pet API
A simple REST API built using node.js and fastify.

I am using the REST Client extension on VS Code to run the  HTTP requests.


## Start the server
I am using **nodemon** dependency to keep the server running during the development. 
```
npm run dev
```

Then, we can run the HTTP requests by navigating to the test.http file.
